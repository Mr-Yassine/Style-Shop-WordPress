== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated the Rara One Click Demo Import plugin. Where can I find the plugin? =

You will find the plugin in *wp-admin -> Appearance -> Rara Demo Import*.

= Where are the demo import files and the log files saved? =

The files used in the demo import will be saved to the default WordPress uploads directory. An example of that directory would be: `../wp-content/uploads/2017/03/`.

The log file will be registered in the *wp-admin -> Media* section.

= I can't activate the plugin because of a fatal error. What can I do? =

*Update: There is an admin error notice, stating that the minimal PHP version required for this plugin is 5.3.2.*

You want to activate the plugin, but this error shows up:

*Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error*

This happens because your hosting server is using a very old version of PHP. This plugin requires PHP version of at least **5.3.x**, but we recommend version *5.6.x*. Please contact your hosting company and ask them to update the PHP version for your site.
